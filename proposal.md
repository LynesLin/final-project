# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

AniMorph: Anime to Real-Life Converter

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A website that convert anime figure into real-life person

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

Establish a website or app that allows users to upload anime figures and convert them into real-life images using existing AI image generation models like Stable Diffusion or other GANs for transformation.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

None

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

None

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

website is successfully established

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Users can upload an image to the website and successfully convert it into a real-life person, excluding quality enhancements.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Being able to input an image and convert it into a lifelike person that is indistinguishable from a real person

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

APIs that make this project easier and more feasible, along with libraries needed to be installed for creating a web interface, handling file uploads, processing images, displaying results, and providing download options on the website, as well as searching for diffuser models for image-to-image transformation.
