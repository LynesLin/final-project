Positive impact to the world:

Mental Health and Emotional Support
Some fans form deep emotional connections with characters. Real-life representations could serve as comforting, motivational, or 
therapeutic companions, especially for individuals who feel isolated or lonely

Empowerment Through Representation
Real-life depictions can bring diverse and underrepresented anime characters to the forefront, encouraging more inclusive storytelling
and character design. Besides, fans could engage more deeply with their favorite characters by seeing them "come to life," promoting
self-expression through cosplay, interaction, or collaborative storytelling
